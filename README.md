**[Mehmet Akif Ersoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire)** (20 December 1873 – 27 December 1936) was an Ottoman-born [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people) poet, writer, academic, politician, and the author of the *[Turkish National Anthem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0stikl%C3%A2l_Mar%C5%9F%C4%B1)*. Widely regarded as one of the premiere literary minds of his time, **Ersoy** is noted for his command of the Turkish language, as well as his patriotism and role in the *[Turkish War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_War_of_Independence).*

A framed version of the national anthem by Ersoy typically occupies the wall above the blackboard in the classrooms of every public as well as most private schools around Turkey, along with a Turkish flag, a photograph of the country's founding father [Atatürk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atat%C3%BCrk), and a copy of Atatürk's speech to the nation's youth.

He currently has a university in his name in **Burdur**. Ersoy's portrait was depicted on the reverse of the *Turkish 100 [lira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_lira) banknotes* of 1983–1989.

# Biography

Mehmet Akif Ersoy was partly of Albanian descent, born as Mehmed Ragîf in Constantinople, Ottoman Empire in 1873 to İpekli Tahir Efendi (1826–1888), an Albanian born in the village Shushica of Istok which was part of the Ipek district (modern-day Peja in Kosovo) and tutor at the Fatih Madrasah, at a time when all institutions of the state were in terminal decline, and major crises and regime changes were underway. His mother, Emine Şerife Hanım from Bukhara (modern Uzbekistan), was of mixed Uzbek and Turkish descent.[3] As he was about to complete his education at the Fatih Merkez Rüştiyesi, his father's death and a fire that destroyed his home, forced Ersoy to interrupt his education and to start working to support his family. He wanted to start a professional career as soon as possible, and he entered the Mülkiye Baytar Mektebi (Veterinary School), and graduated with honors in 1893.

In the same year, Mehmet Akif Ersoy joined the civil service and conducted research on contagious diseases in various locations in Anatolia. During these assignments, in line with his religious inclination, he gave sermons in mosques, and tried to educate the people and to raise their awareness. Along with fellow men-of-letters Recaizade Mahmud Ekrem, Abdülhak Hâmid Tarhan and Cenap Şahabettin, which he had met in 1913, he worked for the publication branch of the Müdafaa-i Milliye Heyeti. He soon resigned from his government position and other occupations, and wrote poems and articles for the publication Sırat-ı Müstakim.

During the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Mehmet Akif Ersoy was a fervent patriot. He made important contributions to the struggle for the declaration of the Turkish Republic, and advocated patriotism through speeches that he delivered in many mosques in Anatolia. On 19 November 1920, during a famous speech he gave in Kastamonu's Nasrullah Mosque, he condemned the Treaty of Sèvres, and invited the people to use their faith and guns to fight against Western colonialists. When the publication Sebilürreşat, which was then operating out of Ankara, published this speech, it spread all over the country and was even made into a pamphlet distributed to Turkish soldiers.
